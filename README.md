This extension allows users to generate a printable VGC team sheet directly from their Pok√©mon Showdown teams. It fills out a PDF form with the team's details, making it easy to print and use during local competitions.

It's intended to ease the process of creating physical team sheets for VGC events by automating it with data from [Pok√©mon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com).

> [!WARNING]
> Remember to double-check the generated PDF before printing.

## Features

- Add a button to the Pok√©mon Showdown team builder interface.
- Generates a downloadable PDF ready for printing.
- Automatically fills in Pok√©mon details including name, moves, items, tera type, and stats.

A special thanks to [alchemistake](https://github.com/alchemistake)üî• for providing the original PDF template.

And of course without the amazing work of the [Pok√©mon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com) team, this extension wouldn't be possible.
